# Repository Moved

This used to be the primary home of the `no-can-transclude` experiments. It
now lives at [WileyLabs/no-can-transclude](https://github.com/WileyLabs/no-can-transclude)
since it's increasingly expanding to include (transclude?) more topics/exploration.

The files here are now attempts to "redirect" readers (UAs or humans) to the
correct publication addresses--given that by moving the repo all the old
publication addresses are now broken (or at least out of date).

Given this is also a core complication for publishing on/for/to the Web, this
repository now serves to explore that situation as well.
